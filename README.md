To run the Python code, which visualizes pathfinding algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* in a randomly generated maze, you'll need to set up your Python environment properly. Here's a guide on how to prepare your environment:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Pip (Python package installer) for installing packages.


Installation Steps
Install Pygame: This code uses Pygame for visualization. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or a terminal in Linux/MacOS) and run the following command:
pip install pygame


Ensure Other Dependencies Are Installed: The code also uses standard libraries random, collections, heapq, math, and time, which are part of the Python Standard Library and should be available in your Python installation.



Running the Code
Prepare Your Script: Copy the provided Python code into a .py file, for example, maze_visualization.py.
Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved maze_visualization.py using the cd command.
Execute the Script: Run the script by executing the following command:
python maze_visualization.py
